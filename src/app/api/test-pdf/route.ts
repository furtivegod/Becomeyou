      overview:
        "This assessment revealed the protective mechanisms that keep you safe from rejection and overwhelm, while simultaneously blocking the financial success and recognition you're capable of achieving.",
      assessment_overview:
        "You've been carrying strategies that once kept you safe from the painful reality that success equals rejection from people you love, but now those same strategies keep you stuck at the threshold of earning what you're worth. Today you've uncovered not just the freeze pattern at the money moment, but why it exists and how it's been protecting you from having to face that everything changes when you fully commit. The good news? Change is possible because now you can see the whole picture clearly. More importantly, you already have proof you can do this - you stay in action and avoid the spiral completely when you're working for others.",
      development_profile:
        "You've built real regulation skills - going from days of stress recovery to catching it in real time shows serious growth. But here's the pattern: you freeze the moment promotion and money enter the picture, not because you can't do the work, but because your system learned early that success means losing connection with the people who matter. You described it perfectly: \"when I succeed or get recognition people treat me different. They talk shit or put me down saying things like don't forget where you come from or you're not better than anyone meanwhile I thought I was making them proud.\" That bind - achieving what you thought would make them proud actually created distance and criticism - taught your nervous system that visibility equals rejection. So now, at the exact moment you need to promote your work and earn, your body hits the brakes: shoulders tense, focus scatters, chest pressure builds, and the shutdown response kicks in. Then comes the escape - Garden Scapes for the hour-long dopamine drip, or porn for the crash that derails your entire day. But here's what matters: when you're working for others, not at home, not isolated, you stay completely connected to the work. The pattern disappears. You already know how to do this. You just need to build the bridge between serving others and serving yourself.",
      bottom_line:
        "Your work is good enough. You know it, and I know it. The problem isn't your skill or your worth - it's that your nervous system still believes that being seen and paid well means losing the people you care about. That belief made sense when you were younger and people actually did treat you differently for succeeding. But it's costing you everything now: your financial freedom, your full potential, your ability to serve the people who actually need your work. You already have proof you can stay in action when you're working for others. The next 30 days are about learning to treat yourself with that same commitment. The freeze response at the money moment isn't weakness - it's a protection pattern that's outlived its usefulness. You can update it. You have to, or five years from now you'll still be stuck at this same threshold, wondering why your talent never translated to the life you know you're capable of building.",
      sabotage_analysis: {
        protective_pattern:
          "Resistance to earning money manifesting as freeze response at the moment of promotion or visibility. This pattern shows up most when you need to put yourself forward for financial recognition or promote your work. When you notice it starting, you'll likely feel the shoulder tension and scattered focus first, followed by the chest pressure and shutdown response - that's your early warning signal. The faster you catch it, the faster you can choose differently.",
        what_its_protecting_from:
          "The fear that success and recognition will destroy your relationships and connection with the people you care about, forcing you to choose between achievement and belonging",
        how_it_serves_you:
          "Staying stuck keeps you connected to your original community and prevents the painful experience of being treated differently, criticized, or rejected for succeeding. It also protects you from the overwhelming reality that fully committing means everything changes - your identity, your relationships, your entire life structure.",

        "When you notice the shoulder tension and scattered focus starting - before the chest pressure builds - pause and take 3 deep breaths: in for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 6. Then ask yourself: What's one small thing I can do right now that moves me forward instead of into escape? It won't stop the pattern completely at first, but it creates the gap where choice becomes possible. If you're at home alone, this is your signal to get out or get around people - you already know your nervous system works differently in those environments.",

Do this outside your home if possible, or with your phone in another room. The cold shower already proves you can do hard things first thing; we're just adding one more.",
        weekly_recommendation:
          "Schedule one 2-hour work session per week at a coffee shop, coworking space, or library where you focus exclusively on your own business promotion and money-generating activities.

        thirty_day_approach:
          "Reframe all self-promotion and business-building activities as service to future clients who need your work, not as self-serving visibility that threatens your relationships. When the freeze response starts at the money moment, immediately shift the frame from I'm promoting myself to I'm connecting my work with people who need it. This addresses the core protective pattern by satisfying both the achievement drive and the connection need simultaneously.",
        environmental_optimization:
          "Remove Garden Scapes from your phone for 30 days and establish a no-porn-at-home rule by committing to leave the house when you notice the foggy brain and escape urge building.
