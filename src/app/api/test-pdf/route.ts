      title: "You 3.0 Behavioral Optimization Assessment Report",
      overview: "This assessment revealed a high-capacity individual with fast learning abilities and natural nervous system regulation, currently trapped in a cycle of escape behaviors (sleep, gaming) that protect against facing the discomfort of building a business without perceived 'talent.'",
      assessment_overview: "You've been carrying a belief that's keeping you small: 'I don't have talent.' But here's what today revealed‚Äîyou're a fast learner with proven ability to push through challenges when you're winning. Your nervous system regulates in minutes, which most people can't do. The pattern that's kept you stuck isn't lack of talent; it's that speaking without thinking, then escaping into sleep (3 hours daily) and games protects you from having to risk failure as a businessman. The good news? You already have proof you can do this‚Äîyou push through when you're winning at games. Now we just need to transfer that same state to your business.",
      development_profile: "You process the world quickly‚Äî'fast learner' were your exact words‚Äîand when decisions matter, you go deep. But there's a split between your capacity and your pattern: you speak without thinking, then your body forces rest through exhaustion and headaches when you've pushed too far. Your face flushing red is your early warning system. What stood out most was your honesty about what staying stuck protects you from: 'play football, or games.' You know the cost. You said your deepest meaning comes from 'desire, hope, work, money'‚Äîfour powerful drivers. Yet something keeps pulling you toward sleep (3 hours daily) instead of toward building what you want. Your words: 'I wanna be a success business man, but I don't have talent.' That belief is the lock. Your fast learning and quick regulation are the keys.",
      bottom_line: "You have the foundation and potential for significant transformation‚Äîthe key is working with your nervous system rather than against it.",
      sabotage_analysis: {
        protective_pattern: "Speaking without deep thinking, then escaping into sleep (3 hours daily) and gaming when overwhelm hits. This pattern shows up most when facing the risk of business failure without perceived talent. When you notice it starting, you'll likely feel exhaustion first‚Äîthat's your early warning signal. The faster you catch it, the faster you can choose differently.",
        what_its_protecting_from: "Fear of failing as a businessman without natural talent; facing the discomfort of not knowing; risking loss of pleasure activities (football, games); experiencing inadequacy publicly",
        how_it_serves_you: "Sleep provides immediate escape from discomfort; gaming gives you the 'winning' feeling you crave without real-world risk; speaking without thinking keeps you from facing deeper truths; avoiding conflict maintains surface-level peace; preserves your self-image by never truly testing yourself",
        go_to_patterns: "Sleep (3 hours daily when avoiding), gaming until winning, reactive speaking, conflict avoidance, oscillating between optimistic decisions and 'bad mode' depending on body state",
        success_proof: "You push through patterns when winning at computer games‚Äîmental state, environment, and support all shift differently in those moments. You regulate stress in minutes (unusual capacity). You're a fast learner. You go deep on important decisions despite reactive speaking habits.",

        body_goal: "Use your body's early warning signals (face flushing, exhaustion) to interrupt escape patterns and redirect energy toward business learning"
      },
      future_vision: "A Tuesday where you wake up after singing, complete your business learning action, and feel the same 'winning' energy you get from games‚Äîbut now it's directed toward building your business. You've reduced your escape sleep to 1.5 hours, you catch your exhaustion signals early, and you're accumulating proof that you're a fast learner who can succeed in business.",
      in_the_moment_reset: "When you notice the exhaustion starting or the pull toward sleep, pause and take 3 deep breaths‚Äîin for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 6. Check if your face is flushing (your signal). Then ask yourself: 'If I were winning right now, what's one small action I'd take?' Match that gaming state to business. It won't stop the pattern completely at first, but it creates the gap where choice becomes possible.",

        regulation_reality: "Your nervous system is actually more flexible than you realize‚Äîregulating in minutes is uncommon. The issue isn't regulation capacity; it's that your system has learned to use sleep as primary coping mechanism (3 hours daily). When you're in 'winning state' from games, all three factors shift: mental state, environment, support. You have the hardware; you're just running old software that says escape is safer than attempting business without 'talent.'"

Before you can escape to sleep, complete one small learning task. Start with researching one successful businessman who wasn't 'talented'‚Äîjust persistent. Your fast learning capacity handles this easily.",
        weekly_recommendation: "Create a 'winning state log' every Sunday: write down when you felt like you were winning this week (gaming or otherwise), what your mental state was, and what one business action would have matched that energy. Your environment already energizes you; now use it intentionally. Set a weekly 30-minute honest conversation about business progress with one supportive person.",
        thirty_day_approach: "Replace one hour of your 3-hour daily sleep escape with skill-building for business (courses, reading, networking). Keep the other 2 hours as actual rest. Reframe 'I don't have talent' to 'I'm a fast learner proving it daily.' Track face flushing and exhaustion signals, then pause and choose action over escape three times weekly. Build business systems in your optimistic body state, execute them even in bad mode. By day 30, you'll have 30 hours of learning invested and proof talent was never the variable.",
        environmental_optimization: "Since money is your biggest external obstacle and your environment already energizes you, create a zero-cost business learning space using your existing setup. Use free online resources, YouTube, podcasts during activities you already do. Turn gaming time into business strategy game (gamify learning). Remove sleep escape triggers: set phone alarm after 2 hours max rest, no gaming before business learning task completed.",
